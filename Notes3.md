# Note

- Some points

---
## Building Blocks
- Component
- Modules
- Templates
- Metadata
- Services

---
- .ts: type script file

---
### Components
- Are the main building block of Angular
- Is created using a TypeScript Class & Decorators
- Class contains the properties & methods
- Decorators contains Template, TemplateUrl, Styles, Selector, etc


---
### Nested Components
- [code] created employee folder

---
### Styling Components
- [code] created student folder

---
### Interpolation
- is created using {{ }}
- can keep a property, method or expressions
- [code] manipulation in student folder, multiplication, use fun name: studName..

---
### Property Binding
- in property binding we cann't do multiplexing, arithmatic operation
- const string concat not possible. Eg: concat Mr. {{name}}
- [code] created student folder

---
### Attribute Binding
- It's used via [attr.name]
- It applicable on html DOM property, Not on html attribute
- Eg: 
	- [colspan] = "colspan" // invalid
	- [attr.colspan] = "colspan" // valid

---
### Class Binding
- css class we bind
- remove/add css classes on run time
- [code] created student folder

---
### Style Binding
- bind style attribute

---
### Events Binding
- for event binding we use `(` & `)` bracks
- [code] created student folder

---
### Two Way Binding
- [code] created student folder

---
### Metadata
- data about data.
- Giving additional information to a angular component. Eg: `my-app`

---
### Reading Data
- iterator array value using `*ngFor`
- show `Data Not Found!` msg using `*ngIf` tag.
- [code] created student folder

---
### Pipes
- Are used to transform data
- can be applied using `|` symbol
- providing different pipes for String, Date, Currency, etc.
- custom pipes can also be created
- [code] created student folder
